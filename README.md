- location based friend finder / networking utility that matches with new friends based on user selecting a country or location of interest. Could be people nearby or in a different country entirely. 

- user inputs location, short bio, profile pic and selects which location of interest they would like to be networked with. Based on city / state/ or country input - the algorithm matches the user with people who have inputted the same location (country or city) and shows the user matched results 
 
  when user is matched with people from location of interest - simulataneously other APIs like flight search API are generated as well as populating some general info about the country like country flag and info from either Wikipedia or CIA Factbook .

  Kayak API or most efficient flight search 
  OpenTable API and /or Hotel API
